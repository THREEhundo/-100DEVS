//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movies = ['Bad Boyz', 'Men in Black', 'Wild Wild West']

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let bestWillSmithMovie = movies[0]

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let length = movies.length

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?

let wild = movies[2]

let reallywilin = movies[movies.length - 1]
